# Roadmap

## Model Execution
- [ ] Implement `Tensor` interface, with better optimized execution code. Either from the `tract::Tensor` or `ndarray` crate, for interface, and operations from `tract::linalg` or `ndarray` crate.

## zk Optimization
- [ ] Implement, `Lookup Table`, and other optimizations mentioned in the `mina-book/mina-zkml` book, for the prover.
- [ ] Simplify the current `Operator` logic, ensure the operations and their corresponding `Circuits` are optimized.
